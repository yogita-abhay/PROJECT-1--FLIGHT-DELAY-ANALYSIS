# PROJECT-1--FLIGHT-DELAY-ANALYSIS
Project Overview: Flight delay analysis involves the systematic evaluation of aircraft performance, & flight operations. This project focuses on analyzing airline performance using flight, Airport & Airline data. The project provides insights and recommendations for improving on-time performance, airline route optimization, Scheduling, flight punctuality and overall airline efficiency. This process supports decision-making in areas like planning, Arrivals and Departures. 

### Objectives:

*Reduce Arrival Variability

*Identify Root Causes

*Optimize Scheduling

*Punctuality

*Visualization

### DATASET OVERVIEWS

### CHALLENGES IN DATA ANALYSIS

* Difficulty loading large data (over 1 million records) into Excel & SQL
  
* Parsing time columns (Departure Time, Wheels Off, Arrival Time, etc) required cleaning and type conversion
  
* Memory optimization issues while performing aggregation queries
  
* Difficulty in converting AM/PM to 24 hr format.
 
### FINAL KPI METRICS

•To get a complete picture of airline performance across operations and reliability.	

•Total flights, cancellations & diversions show overall network activity and reliability.	

•Weekday vs weekend and state/city-wise trends help identify demand and traffic patterns.	

•Busiest airports & routes reveal high-traffic areas that impact scheduling and delays.	

•Delay-related KPIs (average delay, delay reasons, time-of-day) help pinpoint causes and patterns of delay.

•Airline-wise delay analysis highlights the most and least punctual airlines.	

•Punctuality metrics (7-day rolling and on-time performance) track consistency over time.	

•Taxi-in/out times measure ground efficiency and turnaround speed.

•Delay correlation (departure vs. arrival) shows how early issues propagate through the system.	

•Hourly and destination-wise delay rates identify when and where performance drops the most.
